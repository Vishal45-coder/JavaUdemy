Inheritance in java is one of OOP principles

There are five types of inheritance:
i)Single level inheritance
ii)Multilevel inheritance
iii)Hierarchy inheritance 
These 2 cannot be inherited(or executed in java)
iv)Multiple inheritance
v)Hybrid inheritance

i)
Class Subclass extends SuperClass

ii)
Class Subclass1 extends SuperClass
Class Subclass2 extends Subclass1

iii)
Class Subclass1 extends SuperClass
Class Subclass2 extends SuperClass

Why iv and v cannot be executed in java:

class A{  
void msg(){System.out.println("Hello");}  
}  
class B{  
void msg(){System.out.println("Welcome");}  
}  
class C extends A,B{//suppose if it were  
   
 public static void main(String args[]){  
   C obj=new C();  
   obj.msg();//Now which msg() method would be invoked?  
}  
}
